Amsterdam's
name
derives
from
Amstelredamme,[16]
indicative
of
the
city's
origin
around
a
dam
in
the
river
Amstel.
Originating
as
a
small
fishing
village
in
the
late
12th
century,
Amsterdam
became
one
of
the
most
important
ports
in
the
world
during
the
Dutch
Golden
Age
(17th
century),
a
result
of
its
innovative
developments
in
trade.
During
that
time,
the
city
was
the
leading
centre
for
finance
and
diamonds.[17]
In
the
19th
and
20th
centuries
the
city
expanded,
and
many
new
neighbourhoods
and
suburbs
were
planned
and
built.
The
17th-century
canals
of
Amsterdam
and
the
19â€“20th
century
Defence
Line
of
Amsterdam
are
on
the
UNESCO
World
Heritage
List.
Since
the
annexation
of
the
municipality
of
Sloten
in
1921
by
the
municipality
of
Amsterdam,
the
oldest
historic
part
of
the
city
lies
in
Sloten
(9th
century).
